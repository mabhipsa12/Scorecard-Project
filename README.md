Problem Statement:
Predicting Credit Risk Using Applicant and Credit History Data

Financial institutions use credit scoring models to assess the risk of lending to an applicant. The goal of this analysis is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a credit card applicant is a "good" or "bad" client based on their application details and credit history.

Since the dataset does not explicitly define "good" or "bad" clients, a key challenge is to create an appropriate labeling strategy. One possible approach is using vintage analysis to classify applicants based on their credit repayment behavior over time. The dataset also presents a class imbalance issue, as bad credit cases are likely to be fewer than good ones, requiring techniques like resampling or cost-sensitive modeling.
