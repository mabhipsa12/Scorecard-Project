# 📊 Credit_Risk_Scorecard-Development
## 📝 Objective:
Predicting Credit Risk Using Applicant and Credit History Data.

## 📁 Dataset:
Kaggle Link -  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Data Cleaning, EDA, Model Evaluation

## 📈 Process
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Analysis
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building
6. Evaluation
7. Visualization

## 📌 Key Learnings:
Since the dataset does not explicitly define "good" or "bad" clients, a key challenge is to create an appropriate labeling strategy. One possible approach is using vintage analysis to classify applicants based on their credit repayment behavior over time. The dataset also presents a class imbalance issue, as bad credit cases are likely to be fewer than good ones, requiring techniques like resampling or cost-sensitive modeling.
